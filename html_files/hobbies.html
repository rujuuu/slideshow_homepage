            <p>
              Krita is my go-to software for digital art creation. It's perfect
              for painting and illustration, allowing for rich brushes and
              versatile tools for artists of all levels.

            <h2>Chess</h2>
            <p>
              Chess is a game I deeply enjoy. It's a perfect mix of strategy,
              concentration, and problem-solving. I love playing against
              opponents of varying skill levels.

            <h2>Guitar</h2>
            <p>
              Playing the guitar is a relaxing hobby for me. It's a great way to
              unwind and express myself musically. I play a mix of genres, from
              rock to classical.
